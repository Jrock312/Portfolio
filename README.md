# Portfolio
This is our first homework assignment to create a portfolio page with info on us.  We used HTML and CSS to create a few pages with some info on us and projects we have currently.
The second part of this is to use Media queries to make the content of the page change depending on the size of the screen.
please view https://jrock312.github.io/Portfolio to view the page.
