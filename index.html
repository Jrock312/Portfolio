            <em>I am Joel Guevrra and worked as a system support specialist for many years and have recently moved to
                working with my companies Direct Sales website and IT support.
                I am a husband and father of two children, which is my inspiration to want to continue to learn an grow.
                In my spare time I like to drink and "try" to make craft beer as well as watch Warriors and niner games.
